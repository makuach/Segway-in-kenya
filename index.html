        <h1>Segway and Kenya</h1>
        <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway.</p>
        <h2>June 02, 2017</h2>

        <p>My first day of the trip! I can’t believe I finally got everything packed and ready to<br> go. Because I am on a Segway, I wasn’t able to bring lot with me. I was only able to <br>bring the essentials such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cell Phone;</li>
            <li>iPad;</li>
            <li>digital Camera; and</li>
            <li>and a protein bar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, as Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles starts with one<br> step Segway.</p>
        <h2>July 14, 2017</h2>
        <p>I saw some interesting things on the side of the road today:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Passing cars<br>
            when you can’t see,<br>
            may get you<br>
            a little glimpse<br>
            of eternity.<br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>I definitely won’t be passing any car.</p>

        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already and I passed through some interesting places on the<br> way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Limuru;</li>
            <li>Nakuru;</li>
            <li>Naivasha;</li>
            <li>Machakos; and</li>
            <li>many other places.</li>
